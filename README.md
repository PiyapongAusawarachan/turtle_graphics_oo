## this homework
This code generates random polygon art using the turtle graphics module.
It defines two main classes: Polygon and PolygonArt. The Polygon class allows you to create and 
draw simple polygons (with a variable number of sides) and move them to different locations. 
The PolygonArt class lets you generate different patterns of polygons based on user input,
and it includes an option to create "embedded polygons" (smaller polygons inside larger ones) 
through the EmbeddedPolygon class.
